## The Journey

First of all, we're happy the journey was starting.

<!--truncate-->

To be honest, it’s a no brainer. In very simple terms, why would we want to drive a slower car that costs more to run? While BSC might not have the level of adoption Ethereum does at current, we believe in Binance’s ability and drive to get it mighty close in the foreseeable future. Sure, launching on Ethereum would be the easiest thing to do and probably receive faster initial uptake, but we like a challenge and are betting on BSC’s future.

_Little Chef, Remy_

## SYRUP

> Staking

**Stack your CAKE with syrup.**

- 25% of CAKE emissions will be distributed to SYRUP holders every block. Users can claim these rewards and re-invest them.
- CAKE holders can swap CAKE for SYRUP at a 1:1 ratio.
- CAKE is distributed proportionally at each block based on SYRUP holdings.
- We will only record and distribute CAKE rewards to the wallet address that initiated the SYRUP staking. While Syrup can be sent to other addresses only the initiating address will receive the CAKE rewards,
