## Introduction

![img](../static/img/banner.png)

PancakeSwap is an automated market maker (“AMM”) DeFi Protocol, that allows two tokens to be exchanged on the Binance Smart Chain. It is **fast**, **cheap**, and allows anyone to participate.

PancakeSwap incorporates innovations in programmable tokens, financial management, and governance. [CAKE](../en/token#cake) is the Token of SashimiSwap, which is 100% distributed through liquidity mining with no pre-sale, pre-mining and team shares.

#### **The Dream?**

Stacks of pancakes, syrup, whipped cream.

Then after breakfast, PancakeSwap is aiming to be the \#1 liquidity provider on Binance Smart Chain and the home of new, innovative gamified farming mechanics, many of which we suspect will make it to other chains and beyond.

#### **Why Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\)?**

To be honest, it’s a no brainer. In very simple terms, why would we want to drive a slower car that costs more to run? While BSC might not have the level of adoption Ethereum does at current, we believe in Binance’s ability and drive to get it mighty close in the foreseeable future. Sure, launching on Ethereum would be the easiest thing to do and probably receive faster initial uptake, but we like a challenge and are betting on BSC’s future.

Faster, cheaper. **Sold.**

**What makes PancakeSwap different from every other “farm”?**

We’re here to have fun.

What does that mean exactly? We’re going to be trying new things, with a focus on gamification.

## Product

### Exchange

[**Token swaps**](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap) on PancakeSwap are a simple way to trade one BEP-20 token for another via automated liquidity pools.

The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers \("LPs"\) who stake their tokens in "Pools". In exchange, they get FLIP \(PancakeSwap Liquidity Provider\) tokens, which can also be staked to earn CAKE tokens in the "farm".

When you make a token swap \(trade\) on the exchange you will pay a **0.2% trading fee**, which is broken down as follows:

**0.17%** - Returned to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.

**0.03%** - Sent to the PancakeSwap Treasury.

### Pools

#### Farm

[**PancakeSwap pools** ](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/pool)allow you to provide liquidity by adding your tokens to liquidity pools or “LPs”.

When you add your token to a liquidity pool \(LP\), you will receive FLIP tokens \(PancakeSwap’s version of liquidity provider tokens\).

As an example, if you deposited $CAKE and $BNB into a liquidity pool, you would receive CAKE-BNB FLIP tokens.

The number of FLIP tokens you receive represents your portion of the CAKE-BNB liquidity pool. You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.  
[“Simply put

, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet.” - Nate Hindman](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)

It’s not all bad for liquidity providers as you will also be given a reward in the form of trading fees. Whenever someone trades PancakeSwap, the trader pays a 0.2% fee, of which 0.17% is added to the liquidity pool of the swap pair they traded on.

For example:

- There are 10 FLIP tokens representing 10 CAKE and 10 BNB tokens.
- 1 FLIP token = 1 CAKE + 1 BNB
- Someone trades 10 CAKE for 10 BNB.
- Someone else trades 10 BNB for 10 CAKE.
- The CAKE/BNB liquidity pool now has 10.017 CAKE and 10.017 BNB.
- Each FLIP token is now worth 1.00017 CAKE + 1.00017 BNB.

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your FLIP tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield on the [CAKE farms \(here\)](https://pancakeswap.finance/), while still earning your 0.17% trading fee reward.
